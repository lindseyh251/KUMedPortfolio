## Linear Regression Modeling Projects ## 
[Predicting Life Expectancy of Different Countries from Gross Domestic Product.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18525467/Predicting.Life.Expectancy.of.Different.Countries.from.Gross.Domestic.Product.pdf)

This project was completed in R for my Linear Regression course (STAT 840) and investigates the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across different countries between 2000 and 2015 while controlling for other potential sources of variation. 

[Predicting Prostate Specific Antigen Levels from Prognostic Clinical Measurements in Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aaf3e50-7f1c-4b74-a215-51f7569179c9)
[(R Markdown zip)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18524985/Final.Rmd.zip)
[PowerPointSlidesforPSA.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18526051/PSAFinal.pptx)


This project was completed in R for my Introduction to Programming and Applied Statistics course (STAT 823) and performs statistical linear modeling to determine if there is an association between prostate-specific antigen (PSA level) and prognostic clinical measurements in men with advanced prostate cancer. 


## Categorical Data Analysis Project ## 
[Predicting a Death Event from Ejection Fraction Values in Patients with Cardiovascular Diseases.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18525565/FINALpdf.pdf)
[(R Markdown zip)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18525574/MyFinal.Rmd.zip)

This project was completed in R for my Categorical Data Analysis course (STAT 835) and investigates the relationship between a ‚Äúdeath event‚Äù (0,1) and ejection fraction for patients at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan) during April‚ÄìDecember 2015 while controlling for other potential sources of variation.

## Python Project ##
[ArcheryScorer.py.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18525980/ArcheryScorer.py.zip)

This archery scoring game was completed for my undergraduate python course.
